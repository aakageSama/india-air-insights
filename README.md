#AQI Analyzer for India

The Air Quality Intelligence Platform – India is a web-based system designed website to explore how air quality data should be aggregated, validated, and interpreted in real-world conditions where data is fragmented, delayed, and often contradictory.
Rather than presenting air quality as a single definitive value, this project treats AQI as a multi-source signal with inherent uncertainty. It integrates air quality readings from government monitoring networks, international aggregators, historical datasets, and optional local IoT sensor inputs, and compares them transparently to surface discrepancies, reliability gaps, and trust boundaries.
The platform emphasizes data credibility over visual polish. Each AQI source is displayed independently with explicit freshness indicators, confidence labels, and explanatory context. A derived AQI is computed using a confidence-weighted approach, not as ground truth, but as an interpretable indicator that reflects source agreement and data quality.
A key feature of the system is its optional IoT integration. Users may choose to ingest local air quality readings from a simulated or physical IoT sensor. These readings are intentionally treated as uncalibrated signals and are never prioritized over authoritative data. Instead, they are compared against government and international sources to analyze spread, agreement, and potential sensor drift, reflecting how real IoT deployments must reason under uncertainty.
The project is intentionally minimal in infrastructure. It avoids heavy backend services, databases, or machine-learning models, focusing instead on deterministic logic, explainability, and system design judgment. All normalization, validation, and trust reasoning is transparent and auditable.
Overall, this platform demonstrates how an IoT-ready environmental intelligence system should be designed when data, systems, and reality do not align—prioritizing honesty, interpretability, and responsible decision-making over superficial accuracy.
